\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}
Graphics processors have become an efficient accelerator for
high-performance computing. This thesis proposes Mars, which
harnesses the GPU computation power and high memory bandwidth to
accelerate MapReduce frameworks. Mars is applicable to run on
NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and Hadoop-based distributed systems. 
%and can be easily ported to other parallel systems, due to its lock-free design and simple array data structure. 
%In addition, Mars is flexible enough to support a variety of applications efficiently, because of the support of customized workflow. 
Our empirical studies show that Mars
improves the programmability of both the NVIDIA and the AMD GPUs,
and \red{the GPU-CPU co-processing of Mars on an NVIDIA GTX280 GPU and an Intel quad-core CPU outperformed Phoenix, the state-of-the-art MapReduce on the multi-core CPU with a speedup of up to 72 times and 24 times on average.} Additionally, integrating Mars into Hadoop enabled GPU acceleration for a network of PCs.
