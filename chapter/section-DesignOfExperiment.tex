\section{ArduSat}
The HKUST CYT Lab has a lot of ArduSat Nanosatellites. ArduSat is an Arduino based Nanosatellite, based on the CubeSat standard. It contains a set of Arduino boards and sensors. The general public will be allowed to use these Arduinos and sensors for their own creative purposes while they are in space. 
The ArduSat has Triple-axis Accelerometer and Magnetometer (Compass) Board - LSM303. The Gyroscope, accelermoter and magnetometer can output the real time acceleration, angular rate and orientation of the Ardusat. The data trans
