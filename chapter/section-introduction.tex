\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}

MapReduce is a successful paradigm~\cite{Dean2008}, originally proposed by Google,
for the ease of distributed data processing on a large number of machines.
In such a system, users specify two functions:
(1) a {\em map} function to process an input key/value pair,
and to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs;
(2) a {\em reduce} function to merge all intermediate key/value pairs associated with the same key.
The system will automatically distribute and execute tasks on multiple machines~\cite{HADOOP, Dean2008}
or multiple CPUs in a single machine~\cite{Ranger2007}.
Thus, this paradigm reduces the programming complexity so that developers can easily
exploit the parallelism in the underlying computing resources for complex tasks.
Encouraged by the success of CPU-based MapReduce systems, in particular, Phoenix~\cite{Ranger2007},
we develop Mars, a MapReduce system accelerated with graphics processors, or GPUs.

GPUs can be regarded as massively parallel processors with an order of magnitude higher computation
power (in terms of number of floating point operations per second) and memory bandwidth than CPUs~\cite{Ailamaki2006}.
%Moreover, the performance of GPUs is improving at a rate higher than Moore's law for CPUs.
\red{Moreover, the computational performance of GPUs is improving at a rate higher than that of CPUs.}
However, it is a challenging task to program GPUs for general-purpose computing applications, including
those that MapReduce users are familiar with. Specifically, GPUs are traditionally designed as
special-purpose co-processors for dedicated graphics rendering. As such, GPU cores are SIMD
(Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data), which discourages complex control flows. Furthermore, GPU cores are virtualized, and threads are managed by the hardware. Finally,
GPUs manage their own on-board device memory and require programmers to explicitly
transfer data between the GPU memory and the main memory.  Additionally, the architectural details
of GPUs vary by vendors as well as by product releases, and programmer's access to these details is limited.
All these factors make desirable a GPGPU (General Purpose Computation on GPUs) framework
on which users can develop correct and efficient GPU programs easily.

Recently, several GPGPU programming frameworks have been introduced, such as NVIDIA CUDA~\cite{CUDA}, and AMD Brook+~\cite{BROOKPLUS}.
\red{These frameworks significantly improve the programmability of GPUs; nevertheless, their interfaces are vendor-specific and their hardware abstractions may be unsuitable for complex applications such as those running on MapReduce.
Therefore, we propose Mars, a MapReduce framework to ease the programming of such applications on the GPU.} Furthermore, the MapReduce framework of Mars enables the integration of GPU-accelerated code to distributed environment, like Hadoop, with the least effort.
Our Mars system can run on multi-core CPUs (MarsCPU), on CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPUs (MarsCUDA) or Brook+-enabled AMD GPUs (MarsBrook), or on a combination of a multi-core CPU and a GPU on a single machine.
We further integrate Mars into Hadoop~\cite{HADOOP}, an open-source CPU-based MapReduce system on a
network of machines, which results in MarsHadoop, where each machine can utilize its GPU with MarsCUDA or MarsBrook
in addition to its CPU with the original Hadoop. No matter what GPU and/or CPU Mars runs on, the API (Application
Programming Interface) to the user is the same and is similar to that of existing CPU-based MapReduce systems.

Easing up GPU programming for MapReduce applications is the main goal of our work. However, a higher-level
abstraction for programming, specifically MapReduce, comes at a price of performance.
In particular, we identify the following three technical challenges in implementing Mars on GPUs.
%First, since MapReduce divides up a task by data, data skews are an inherent problem in utilizing
First, since MapReduce divides up a task by data, load imbalance is an inherent problem in utilizing
the massive thread parallelism on the GPU, especially because GPU threads are managed by the hardware.
\red{Second, GPUs lack efficient global synchronization mechanisms. Threads in Map or Reduce tasks are likely to have write conflicts on the output buffer.
%Although NVIDIA GPUs provide atomic operations on the global memory, the performance of these atomic operations is so poor that using them performs worse than using the CPU \cite{ATOMIC}. Therefore, the overhead of atomic operations harm the scalability of massive GPU threads.
While atomic operations are enabled in recent GPUs, the overhead of atomic operations would harm the scalability of massive GPU threads \cite{ATOMIC}. We consider a lock free scheme to minimize the synchronization overhead among GPU threads.}
%It is desirable to implement a extremely low-overhead thread synchronization mechanism.
%Therefore, it is mandatory to implement thread synchronization, and the synchronization overhead must be low so as to scale to the massive number of GPU threads.
Third, MapReduce applications are in general data-intensive and their result sizes are data-dependent. These two characteristics pose the following requirements on programming the GPU: (a) sufficient  thread parallelism to hide the high latency and to utilize the high bandwidth of the device memory; (b) pre-allocation of output buffers in the device memory for bulk DMA transfers, as GPU memory allocation is done through the CPU before the GPU program starts.

With these challenges in mind, we develop Mars for GPUs of two most
common programming interfaces - CUDA and Brook+. We focus on
MarsCUDA, than MarsBrook, because in our implementation
and evaluation, CUDA was more flexible and had a higher performance than Brook+
for MapReduce applications.

In MarsCUDA, the massive thread parallelism on the GPU is well utilized
as each thread is automatically assigned a key/value pair to work on.
In {\em Map}, the system evenly distributes key/value
pairs to each thread. In {\em Reduce}, we develop a simple but effective
\red{skew handling scheme to re-distribute data evenly across all reduce tasks. }To avoid write conflicts between
threads, we adopt a lock-free scheme that guarantees the
correctness of parallel execution with little synchronization
overhead. 

We extend our general design of Mars from a GPU-only MapReduce framework to a MapReduce system with GPU acceleration enabled. With this extension, Mars components can work stand-alone on a single platform, e.g., MarsCUDA on a CUDA-enabled GPU or MarsCPU on a multi-core CPU, as well as to work together to utilize multiple processors, e.g., a CPU and a GPU on a single machine.
We also integrate Mars into Hadoop to enable GPU-acceleration for individual machines in a distributed environment.

\red{We evaluated the performance of Mars in comparison with its CPU-based counterparts and the native implementation without MapReduce. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our  GPU-oriented  optimization  strategies. On average, our MarsCUDA is 22 times faster than the CPU-based MapReduce, Phoenix~\cite{Ranger2007}, and is less than 3 times slower than the hand-tuned native CUDA implementation. Additionally, the applications developed with Mars had a code size reduction up to seven times, compared with hand-tuned native CUDA code.}
