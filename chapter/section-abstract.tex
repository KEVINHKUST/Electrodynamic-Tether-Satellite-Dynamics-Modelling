More than 500,000 pieces of debris, or “space junk,” are tracked as they orbit the Earth. They all travel at speeds fast enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft.The rising population of space debris increases the potential danger to all space vehicles, but especially to the International Space Station, space shuttles and other spacecraft with humans aboard. Tether satellite system, designed as a space debris sweeper or scavenger, will play a more and more important role in the aerospace industry.  

In this thesis lots of tether missions and tether satellite dynamic modeling methods are analyzed and compared. A detail and self-contained tether satellite system dynamics model and its MATLAB implementation are given. The data communication of test sample- Arduino DemoSat integrated physical sensors and data plotting/collection using MATLAB serial communication are achieved. Also the design of air bushing planar torque free Motion testbed is fabricated and refined.
